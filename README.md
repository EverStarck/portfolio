## About the portfolio

![ScreenShot of EverStarck portfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51029456/129105683-00580fef-5713-48fc-8178-2c30e06ce451.png)


I designed the portfolio from scratch with figma and built it with NextJs and Node.
  It shows 3 of my projects, but they are not all I have. I have made quite a few sites that handle requests and also some CRUD. I chose those projects because they are the ones that seem most interesting to me. A Google clone that works without redirects? How can that be possible?
